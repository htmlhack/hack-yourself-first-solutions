#3 Cookie Invalidation after logout

Summary: When users logout from the application, they strongly believe that no one can access their account. But cookie invalidation breaks that.
Steps to reproduce: Login to your account in 2 browsers, logout from one and go to the second browser and reload the page, and you can see the session is still active in that browser
Impact: Even if a user logout of their account, still the attacker can login using the same session cookie.
