#20 Edit profile using CSRF

Summary: CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) makes an attacker to reset password of the victim
Steps to reproduce: Create an account and logoff. Go to login page and go to forgot password, enter email and click reset. Now capture the request in burp. Then right click on the request, click on engagement tools, and Generate CSRF PoC. In options, enable Include auto-submit script, and click Regenerate and copy the code and drop the request. Now, create a HTML file in your system and paste the copied CSRF PoC and save and run the file. Now you can see that it says "Your password has now been reset, you should receive an email with a new one shortly." This similar to #14 and #15 but with different attack method.
Impact: Due to this bug, an attacker can reset password of a legit user without their knowledge, and here most of the users created account using fake email. So it will cause permanent account lockout.
